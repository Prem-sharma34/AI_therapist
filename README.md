## üåü Overview

**AI-Therapist** is a web-based mental health companion that enables users to engage in **empathetic conversations** via **chat or voice**.  
It is **not professional therapy**, but rather a **safe, private, and reflective space** where users can share their feelings without judgment.  

- **Privacy-first:** No databases, no permanent logs. All conversations live only in the session cache and vanish once closed.  
- **Empathy-focused:** Responses are designed to feel human, warm, and supportive rather than robotic.  
- **Voice & Text:** Supports natural speech in English and Indian languages.  
- **Accessible:** Works directly in the browser with no signup required.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Anonymous Mode (implemented)**  
  - Start a conversation instantly, without identity or signup.  
  - Conversations exist only in the current browser session.  

- **Normal Mode (planned)**  
  - Optional mode to allow non-anonymous entry (not yet implemented).  

- **Voice + Text Interaction**  
  - Sarvam AI powers **text-to-speech (TTS)** for better Indian language audio output.  
  - Speech-to-text support for natural voice conversations.  

- **Therapist Personas**  
  - Multiple conversation styles (existential, crisis, reflection, emotions, boundaries).  
  - Adaptive responses with validation, reflection, and gentle probing.  

- **Crisis Safeguards**  
  - If severe distress indicators are present, the AI encourages contacting professional or emergency help (e.g., India: dial **112**).  

- **Privacy by Design**  
  - No database, no cloud storage.  
  - All memory is **session-based** ‚Äî conversations disappear after closing the tab.

## üö® Disclaimers

- **Not a substitute for professional help**

## üîç Known Limitations
